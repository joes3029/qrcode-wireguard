Wireguard QR Code Generator for Mikrotik

Unless you're using a newer ARM Mikrotik, the QR codes and configs generated for you aren't always correct for new clients you're wanting to add.

Using this basic Laravel app, you can save your router public key and endpoint. Provide your new client IPs and private keys, and scan the automatically generated QR Code or copy the config. It's that easy.

QR Code generation happens in the browser, so your private key is never sent to the server.
